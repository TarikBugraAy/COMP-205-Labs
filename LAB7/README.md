### Student Grade Management System
### Overview
* This C program is designed to manage and analyze student grades for multiple subjects. It reads student names and their grades from a file and calculates the average grades for each subject. The program showcases the use of structures, file handling, and basic data manipulation in C.

### Features
- Reading student names and grades from a text file.
- Storing data in structures for organized access.
- Calculation of average grades for each subject.
- Clear display of each student's grades and subject averages.


### Input File Format
* The input file, scores.txt, should contain the data in the following format:

- The first line for each student should contain the student's name.
- The following three lines should contain the student's grades in English, Math, and Physics, respectively.
* Example:

	```sh
		Alice
		90
		85
		88
		Bob
		78
		82
		80
		[...]

### Output
* The program will output:

- Each student's name and their respective grades in English, Math, and Physics.
- The average grades for each subject across all students.

### Contributions
* This project is part of an educational exercise in learning C programming. Suggestions and improvements are welcome, but please note that this is a beginner's project, primarily for learning purposes.
